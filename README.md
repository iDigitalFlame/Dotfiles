# My Dotfiles

This is a repository that contains my dotfiles (configuration files) for my personal laptop.

Themes, scripts and settings for GUIs/Window Managers are located here.
Resources and configurations for additional programs, such as ~~Polybar~~ Waybar are also located in this repo.

Plays nicely with the System Management Daemon (SMD) <https://github.com/iDigitalFlame/spaceport>

It's using Wayland btw :D
